Sandbagging
===========

[Sandbagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbagging) means hiding the strength, skill or difficulty of
something or someone early in an engagement. It is also a lightweight alternative to
[Sandcastle](http://shfb.codeplex.com), more specifically: a .Net Xml documentation to Html converter.

You can obtain an Xml documentation file by setting the XML documentation path under build options.

The interface is simple: just drag and drop the XML Documentation file on the GUI and it will generate
a temp output dir with a html file for each class and an index.html.

Decided to use [HelpNDoc](http://www.helpndoc.com/) as a backend so I don't have to worry about writing
a search engine. HelpNDoc is a commercial product, but is free for non commercial use.
