Sandbagging
===========

A lightweight .Net Xml documentation to Html converter

Generates Html documentation for Visual Studio projects based on the Xml documentation file.

You can obtain the Xml documentation file by checking this option in the Build properties of
your Visual Studio project and setting the path.

Currently there is no GUI yet to set the path in the Sandbagging project, but will do that soon.
For now you will have to change the path in the code yourself.
