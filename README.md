Sandbagging
===========

[Sandbagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbagging) has many meanings and now it has
one more: A lightweight .Net Xml documentation to Html converter.

You can obtain an Xml documentation file by setting the XML documentation path under build options.

Currently there is no GUI yet to set the path in the Sandbagging project, but will do that soon.
For now you will have to change the path in the code yourself.
