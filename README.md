Sandbagging
===========

[Sandbagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbagging) means hiding the strength, skill or difficulty
of something or someone early in an engagement.

It is also a lightweight alternative to [Sandcastle](http://shfb.codeplex.com), more specifically: a .Net Xml documentation to Html converter.

You can obtain an Xml documentation file by setting the XML documentation path under build options.

Currently there is no GUI yet to set the path in the Sandbagging project, but will do that soon.
For now you will have to change the path in the code yourself.
